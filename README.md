# Library Management System (LMS)

## Description
The Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution implemented in C to automate library operations. It leverages Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for efficient book management, user authentication, and transaction tracking. This project demonstrates the practical application of arrays, linked lists, queues, hash maps, and binary search trees.

## Features
- **User Login/Signup**: Secure user registration and authentication.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, categorize, and search for books.
- **Borrow/Return System**: Track book transactions with a queue-based mechanism.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage books, users, and generate activity reports.

## DSA Concepts Used
- **Arrays**: Store user and book data.
- **Linked Lists**: Manage dynamic sessions and data.
- **Queues**: Handle borrowing/returning operations.
- **Hash Maps**: Enable quick lookups for books by title or author.
- **Binary Search Trees**: Optimize catalog searches.
